TV

The current state of Snapchat is TV.  A better version of Vine, but the pure essence of ADD placed in a story.  Film yourself, sure, but the better the production value and content the more views. And views are life.

Paid Users

The currency of social media right now is the follow.  With a follow, you inch one step closer to getting stuff for free from sponsors.  With enough followers, people will start to pay you cash to talk about their products.  With max-level followers, you can create your own products and cut out the middle man.  In a roundabout way, followers = cash.  But that's a tough exchange of value because it's like medieval times.

I grow carrots.  I want a candle so I can stay up past sundown and see things.  But the candlemaker wants bread and, well, I don't have bread.  I have to trade my carrots for bread, and bread for the candle.  This is the current state of social media value exchange.

Snapchat has to cut out the middleman and create a universal barter system.  Some way to exchange a follow for money.  But how do you give the followers some kind of currency to fork over to their celebs?
