                June 2017 Â· 4 minute read
            </div>

            <div class="entry-content">
                <p>I built this website without ever stepping in to a classroom.  I never met my teachers.  But I was able to get Hugo to generate a static website and deploy that to Amazon S3 and set up my SSL certificate and set the DNS on dyment.org in 2 hours.  I did this with Google leading me around the internet, and Youtube (owned by Google).</p>

<p>If you are having a child in 2017, that child will be turning 18 in 2035.  Assuming they are being raised in a G7 country, they will be in school for about 10 months a year for 13 or so of these years.  They may start school at around age 5 with limited reading, writing, mathematics, music, science, programming, visual arts, and shoelace tying skills.  Or, if they had an attentive care giver in those early years, developed a curious mind, and spent a great deal of time on an iPad, they could start Grade 1 having spent hundreds of hours learning at their own pace, about topics that interest them, from the best minds in the world.</p>

<p>One function of the education system is imbuing the populace with knowledge and skills.  If nobody could read, it would be impossible to share information via writing.  That&rsquo;s pretty critical for everyone around you to know that.  Beyond that, specialist knowledge like physics and chemistry and iambic pentameter are taught to everyone with the though that the more you know, the more you can learn because knowledge shapes the mind.  This has been working pretty well to date but I see this approach needing some tweaking in the coming years.</p>

<p>School should be about teaching people how to think, and how to discover varieties of things on the internet.  Effectively the teacher becomes a Google librarian and curates knowledge.  There is too much on the internet for a 5 year old to be able to grasp the entirety, and the school-age years should be about curiousity, experience, and discovery.  Young minds still need guidance, and teachers are in the best possible position to provide that.  But they don&rsquo;t need to provide the education - that&rsquo;s what the internet should be for.</p>

<p>Should a child with no interest in political geography need to memorize the capitals of different countries?  Or should that child be made aware of the concept of countries, and capitals, and should they seem keen be led to some wonderful online lectures, websites, and online games to reinforce there new knowledge.</p>

<p>With the traditional layout of a single teacher managing 30 or so pupils, it is impossible for that person to deliver a customized education to each child.  Especially so since the spend much of their time managing social issues in the classroom - another important function of school to be discussed later, but one that seems to be at odds with delivering knowledge.  That lone teacher runs a series of classes each focused on a topic, so that by the end of a 6 hour school day, 4-6 different topics are taught, tested, and tucked away.  Each child in the class sits through the same lecture, delivered in the same way by the same person.  By no fault of the instructor, this is bound to impact some children more than others.  Some people are visual learners.  Others learn through sound.  Some like words, and others pictures.  Some like learn best when they can ask as many questions as possible whenever they feel they need.  Others prefer to listen to a lecture in it&rsquo;s entirety, digest it, and compose a list of follow-up questions at a later date.  The best teacher in the world is still not the best teacher for <strong>everybody</strong>.</p>

<p>Those different types of learners are now able to find their perfect match online.  These children would, of course, need to self-assess and be taught awareness so that they can determine their best way of learning (and to be taught that learning things is good), but, assuming they know, I feel that the efficiency of knowledge transfer would be increased greatly.</p>
